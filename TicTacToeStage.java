//TODO:
/*
 *  1. Remember the following information:
 *      - the TicTacToePiece that is passed as a parameter to the constructor (this is your piece)
 *      - all of the PieceActor objects in a 2d array so they can be referenced in other methods
 *  2. Instead of creating a new TicTacToe game in the constructor, just remember the TicTacToe game that was passed as a parameter
 *  3. Implement the updatePiece method that tells the PieceActor at (row, col) to update itself to display the appropriate piece (X or O)
 *  4. Change the if/else condition in update so that it displays "Your turn" and "Waiting for opponent" instead of "It is X's turn" and "It is O's turn"
 *  5. Change the if/else condition in update so that it displays "You win!" and "You lose." instead of "X wins!" and "O wins!"
